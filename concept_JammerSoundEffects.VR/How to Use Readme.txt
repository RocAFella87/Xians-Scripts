1.) Move the Radio%20Jammer folder into your compositions folder (Arma 3 Other Profiles\your Arma 3 username\compositions)
2.) Move the mission files over into your mission (DO NOT MOVE the mission.sqm file as it will overwrite ALL of your mission)
3.) Play close attention to the description.ext file. If you have one already, you'll need to adjust yours to add in the information in mine.
4.) Most of the scripts for the jammers is IN the composition. Simply open your mission and plop it down. You should see the trigger area.
5.) That's it! You don't need to edit anything really. Feel free to take a look through the scripts at my notes. Let me know if you have any questions!
